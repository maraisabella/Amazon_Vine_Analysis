## Summary

In conclusion, based on our data we can infer that there was nearly no bias between those reviews that were a part of the Amazon Vine program and those that were not. Nevertheless, in order to improve the accuracy of our analysis we could try checking the verification of these reviews to cross-reference and check that those reviews provided in our analysis were legitimate and genuine.
